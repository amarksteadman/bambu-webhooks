Menus
=====

If you use `Bambu Navigation <https://github.com/iamsteadman/bambu-navigation>`_,
the automatic menu builder for web apps, Bambu Webhooks will append a 'webhooks' item to the menu reserved
for logged-in users. This links them through to the view that allows them to specify the URLs that are to be
called when the webhook is fired.
